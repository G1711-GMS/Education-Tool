As an early years teacher, I spend hours searching for AI apps to help me generate worksheets quickly with more options. I also need an app to convert any script into an animated story. while some apps exist, they lack the specific options teachers need for quick, high quality generation. Current ai tools that attempt to transform scripts into stories are inefficient and do not meet classroom standards. 

​Teachers need an app to bring characters to life. we need a tool that doesn't make a video, but allows us to customize characters bychoosing specific costumes and use high quality 3D animations so young children can understand the play much easier. Also, we need advanced worksheet options by generating educational materials quickly with special formatting. In modern education, AI nowadays is a necessity. However, it must be useful and practical. This app would really help teachers to turn their vision into reality and make a genuine diffrence in the classroom experience for children.
